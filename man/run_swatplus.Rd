\arguments{
\item{project_path}{Character string that provides the path to the SWAT project
folder (i.e. TxtInOut).}

\item{output}{Define the output variables to extract from the SWAT model
runs. See function \code{\link{define_output}} help file to see how to
define simulation outputs.}

\item{parameter}{(optional) SWAT model parameters either provided as named
vector or a tibble. The parameter changes provided with \code{parameter}
are performed during the model execution accordingly. To learn how to
modify parameters see the \href{https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/SWATplusR.html}{Get started} page of \code{SWATplusR}.}

\item{start_date}{(optional) Start date of the SWAT simulation. Provided as
character string in any ymd format (e.g. 'yyyy-mm-dd'), numeric value
in the form yyyymmdd, or in Date format.}

\item{end_date}{(optional) End date of the SWAT simulation. Provided as
character string in any ymd format (e.g. 'yyyy-mm-dd'), numeric value
in the form yyyymmdd, or in Date format.}

\item{output_interval}{(optional) Time interval in which the SWAT model
outputs are written. Provided either as character string ("d" for daily,
"m" for monthly, or "y" for yearly, and "a" for average annual)}

\item{years_skip}{(optional) Integer value to define the number of simulation
years that are skipped before writing SWAT model outputs.}

\item{start_date_print}{(optional) Start date for printing of the simulation
outputs. \code{start_date_print} overrules \code{years_skip}. Provided
as character string in any ymd format (e.g. 'yyyy-mm-dd'), numeric value
in the form yyyymmdd, or in Date format.}

\item{run_index}{(optional) Numeric vector (e.g.\code{run_index = c(1:100,
  110, 115)}) to run a subset of the provided \code{parameter} sets. If NULL
all provided parameter sets are used in the simulation.}

\item{run_path}{(optional) Character string that provides the path where the
'.model_run' folder is written and the SWAT models are executed. If NULL
'.model_run' is built in the project folder.}

\item{n_thread}{(optional) Number of threads to be used for the parallel
model run. If not provided models are run on single core. The parameter is
ineffective for single simulations.}

\item{save_path}{(optional) Character string to define the path where the
model runs are saved if \code{save_file} is defined. If \code{save_path = NULL}
the \code{save_file} is saved in the project_path.}

\item{save_file}{(optional) Character string to define the name of the folder
where data bases are generated that store the simulations incrementally.}

\item{return_output}{(optional) Logical. Whether outputs should be returned
or not. Set \code{return_out = FALSE} and provide \code{save_file} if
outputs should only be saved on the hard drive and not be returned in R.
'\code{Default = TRUE}}

\item{add_parameter}{(optional) Logical. If \code{add_parameter = TRUE}, the
values of the parameter changes and information on the changes are saved
and/or returned together with the model outputs. \code{Default = TRUE}}

\item{add_date}{(optional) Logical. If \code{add_date = TRUE} a date column
is added to every simulation output table.  \code{Default = TRUE}}

\item{refresh}{(optional) Logical. \code{refresh = TRUE} always forces that
'.model_run' is newly written when SWAT run ins started. \code{Default =
  TRUE}}

\item{keep_folder}{(optional) Logical. If \code{keep_folder = TRUE}
'.model_run' is kept and not deleted after finishing model runs. In this
case '.model_run' is reused in a new model run if \code{refresh = FALSE}.
\code{Default = FALSE}}

\item{quiet}{(optional) Logical. If \code{quiet = TRUE} no messages are
written.  \code{Default = FALSE}}

\item{revision}{(optional) Numeric. If \code{revision} is defined
\code{run_swatplus()} uses the input revision number (e.g. \code{revision = 59.3}.
Otherwise the revision number is acquired from the SWAT executable.}

\item{time_out}{(optional) Numeric. Timeout for simulation in seconds.
Simulations may get stuck due to specific parameter combinations. A timeout
kills any simulation if the runtime exceeds the set time in seconds.
Be careful with this setting as a timeout set too short will also kill
all potentially sucessful runs before finishing.}
}
\value{
Returns the simulation results for the defined output variables as a
tibble. If more than one parameter set was provided a list of tibbles is
returned where each column is a model run and each list entry is an output
variable.
}
\description{
This function allows to run a SWAT+ project in R. Basic
settings for the SWAT run such as the simulation period or the time interval
for the outputs can be done directly. SWAT simulation outputs can be
defined that are returned in a 'tidy' format in R. Functionality such as model
parametrization, parallel execution of simulations, or incremental saving of
simulation runs is provided.
